# ðŸ–¤ BleakHeart 

An asynchronous BLE Heart Monitor library that supports additional measurements  available from Polar sensors through the Polar Measurement Data interface (currently, ECG and accelerometer data from the Polar H10, and PPG from the Polar Verity). 

BleakHeart is written in Python using the [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) framework; BLE communication is based on [Bleak](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).

## Installation

Install from PyPI using ```pip```:
```
python3 -m pip install "bleakheart"
```

## Features

* Supports heart rate acquisition for devices supporting the standard BLE [heart rate service](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/heart-rate-service-1-0/), including RR intervals, instant heart rate, energy expenditure and (client-based) time stamps;
* Reads Accelerometer and ECG signals from the Polar H10 chest strap;
* Reads PPG data from the Polar Verity, including in SDK mode;
* Offers partial support for other measurements available through the Polar Measurement Data interface, possibly from other devices;
* Normalises Polar sensor timestamps to Epoch time; 
* Reads the battery charge state through the standard BLE [battery service](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specs/battery-service/) (also available on other types of BLE devices);
* Compatible with Jupyter Notebooks (IPython version 7+, IPykernel version 5+).

## Usage

BleakHeart supports a variety of software design choices. Specifically:
* A data producer/consumer model can be easily implemented by asking BleakHeart to push sensor data onto asynchronous queues;
* Alternatively, data can be sent to a callback. Simple tasks such as sensor logging can be accomplished with only a minimal understanding of ```asyncio```;
* All data are tagged with their measurement type; thus the same queue or callback can be used to handle different types of measurements if desired.

Please see the [getting_started](examples/getting_started.ipynb) notebook in the examples directory, or see this [video introduction](https://youtu.be/WzNl-cQH7HU).

The examples directory also contains detailed stand-alone examples for some of the possible workflows. Use the ```help``` function on BleakHeart objects for more information.

## Limitations

BleakHeart has mainly been tested on a Polar H10 chest strap under Linux and on a Verity sensor under Windows. However, reports from Windows and MacOS users have been positive. Other Polar devices are only partly supported; measurements other than ECG and acceleration on the H10, and PPG on the Verity, are returned as raw bytearrays. Offline recording to the internal Polar H10 memory is not supported.
